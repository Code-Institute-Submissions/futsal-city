# Project Purpose:
## My Goal
There are so many local football clubs that have websites that are poorly done. Their content is not responsive, so it looks good on desktop but looks horrible on mobile. This always annoys me because whenever I want to find some information about my local football team it is always a struggle and a pain. The text is not aligned properly on the page. The style looks like its from the 1990's, it just does not feel modern. 

I want to build a sleek website, that looks modern and is able to adapt to modern requirements such as being responsive for desktop and mobile. I want the website to have all the most relevant information and to make the supporter's life easier. Most football sites do not include navigation links to fixtures, I want to add these links so that supporters can easily see where games are being played, without them having to copy and paste the location into a new window.

Often when looking on local teams websites they have a lot of wasted space or the content does not fit into the layout properly. I want to try and maximise space without putting to much stuff onto the screen as many websites can put to much content onto a page and the page can become confusing and the visitor can be put off visiting the site due to the poor layout.

## Target Audience
The General Public, club supporters and appealing to Corporate Sponsors.
## Relevant Content
Show past and future fixtures to give supporters an idea of how the team has been doing.
Contact form, so supporters can email club about purchasing tickets and/or any other questions they may have. Also easier for potential corporate sponsors to get into contact with the club about potential sponsorship deals.
Club news on home page for supporters to keep up-to-date with anything happening at the club.
Club Social Events to increase supporter engagement at the club.
Mini-gallery on home page helps add colour to the page as well as show off the club kit and players. Showing club kit will increase the chances of site visitors buying the kit, thus increasing cash flow.
## Supporter Needs
Club information with regard to fixtures and results. Keeping fixtures and results up to date means supporters know they can rely on the club keeping them up-to-date with how the club is doing. Lowering the posibility of supporters using other sites for that information, meaning supporters are more engaged with the site and the club.

# Typography and Colour Scheme:
## Typography
Andika New Basic, sans-serif as back-up.
## Header
Header will be a dark dirty gold (#BF9000). It'll be this colour to match the secondary colour in the clubs badge. Any font in this section will be Black (#131313) to contrast with the background.
## Body
Body will be black (#131313), as this will match the main colour of the clubs badge. The font colour will be white to contrast the black(#131313) background.
## Footer
Footer colour will match the header colour (#BF9000). This will help with the aesthetic and uniformity of the website pages. The footer font colour will also match the header. Font colour will be black (#131313) as it will contrast with the gold background.
## Drop-down Menu
The menu will have a white background and black font. This is to contrast the menu with the rest of the site.

# Meeting User Stories Needs

1. When a supporter lands on the page the first thing they see is the next fixture with all the relevant details. They are also able to click on the location of the fixture to help them navigate to the stadium. Adding in these links throughout the website helps to increase the supporter's reliability on the website as the website has all the information they require, and they can easily use the links to then navigate to the fixture. 

2. Below the Next Fixture section on the home page is a snippet of club news. This section has been made responsive so that depending on how long the news article, the section will become scroll able. By making the section responsive and scroll able it stops it from taking up a lot of space on the page. At the end of the news article is a link to the rest of the statement. 

3. Letting supporters buy tickets via the website is a future feature that will be added, as adding a payment portal requires a higher skill set than I have at the moment. This is why I also decided against doing the modal at the top of the screen, I felt like it would have been an unnecessary feature. 

4. Any potential commercial partner, supporter or visitor can easily contact the club via the contact form. When fulling out the form they only need to give relevant details like their full name and email address. I decided to not give the option of mobile number as that is not a good way to communicate with supporters. I also wanted a simple and straight forward form as some forms can be difficult to full out because you have so many options to choose from such as mobile number, address, date of birth etc. 

5. On the season 20/21 page supporters can see all the latest updates regarding fixtures and results. They are able to see our 5 most recent results with the scorelines. They are also able to see the next 5 fixtures and whether they are home or away. With each fixture also have links to each respective stadium. This helps supporters see which stadium is closest to them for away games, so they are able to see if they can attend the game. All results and fixtures have the dates of when the game was played and when future games will be played. On this page supporters can also see the comments from the club captain and manager. These two sections are responsive and scroll able like the club news section on the home page. This is once again to save on space. 

6. At the bottom of the page in the footer are the icons of 4 major social media companies. When clicked on these icons will take the supporter to the relevant social-media page. This is important for any modern sport team to do as social media plays a big part in today's society. By having a big social media following this can increase the clubs domestic and potentially global reach. 

7. The countdown to the next fixture I was unable to do because I was not able to figure out how to code it. This feature could be a future feature to be added along with the buying of tickets via the website.

Future/skeptical supporters may be put off attending their first game due to not knowing how to buy tickets or put off by the process of having to email the club in order to buy tickets.

# Comments from code

* Making the header sticky makes it easier for the visitor to change pages by always having the menu at the top of the page,
the club logo also has css that means when clicked the user will go back to the home page
* Did this bit of code twice as i am not sure how to properly code and style it to look how I wanted it to look. I needed the content to be slip in half when on large screens and then to be in the middle when on smaller screens.This is why i have change the code below to be one div, whereas the code above is in two seperate divs (Comment from Next-fixture section in index.html)
* I went with this layout because it is clean and adds some extra colour to the page. I got the inspiration from the Love Running Project, and thought this is the best way to show off events that are coming up as it shows all the keep information in a snippet and does not take up unneccessary space. (Comment from social-events section in index.html)
* I want the visitor to always be able to click the link for the stadiums address as this will help them with navigating to the stadium. I saw how the footer looked in the Resume Miniproject and thought it would suit what I wanted to achieve in this code. Having social-links is essential for any footer and all new social-media accounts can easily be added to this code when the club opens a new account (Comment for footer on all pages).
* This code starts with the date and then has spaces on either side of the '-' to improve the visual appearance. Each result shows a different fontawesome icon, a draw="fa-equal", win="fa-check-cirlce", loss="fa-times-circle". Adding these fontawesome icons improve the visual representation of each results and gives the visitor the ability to only need to glance at the results in the future due to them knowing what each icon means (Comments for results-fixtures in season.html).
* Each stadium has a hyperlink for visitors to click on so that can easily navigate to the stadium, the hyperlinks below go to google maps and they open in a separate window (Comment for links to stadiums in season.html)
* This is just a simple form for visitors to full out if they wish to get into contact with the club. It does not require visitors to give up a lot of information on the bare essentials in order for the club to respond back to them. I used the code from User Centric Frontend Development as inspiration. In the future there can be further optons added to the form such as marketing preferences and opting in to receive updates from the club for future fixtures or social-events. (Comment for contact form section in contact.html").

# Comments from CSS

* This css resizes the club-logo to be smaller when on a smaller device, if the image stayed the same size it would take up to much space on the screen. I went with 100 x 100px for the logo because it needed to be a square and when it is smaller than this it does not look appealing, the logo ends uo looking to small (logo.container)
* This code moves the position of the dropdown button to the right side of the screen and into the middle. This makes it easier for visitors to click the menu as it is seperaye from the club-logo and has no other clickable links around it (Navbar)
* This code moves the dropdown button to the centre of the page on smaller devives and leaves a gap between it and the logo, leaving a gap lowers the chances of the visitor clicking the club-logo, which when clicked goes back to the home page (button.location)
* Lowering padding for images to make them bigger on smaller devices, images were looking to small on smaller devices, making it hard to see them nicely.Lowering the padding means the images can take up more space on the page, making the images easier to see (img.container)
* Sets the background image for the social-events section on index.html page. Background position put to left due to the stadium being to the left of the image and I wanted that to be the main focus and not the lights from the traffic (social-events)
* This code changes the divs from being aligned vertically next to each other to being aligned horizontally below each other. This is because when they are aligned vertically next to each other on smaller screens the content becomes cramped up. Got the idea from @JimLynx_lead in slac. (social-events-responsive)
* Positions last-results to the left and next-fixtres to the right. Next-fixtures position set to relative and bottom set to 80%. 80% puts the heading inline with the last-results heading Width for both set to 50% as they are both on the same line and need to look equal (last-results)
* Height of section increases by 200% due to next-fixtures going below last-results. Due to next-fixtures going below last-results the total space required increases by 200%, both divs now take up 100% of the width due to them being below each other and needing to take up more space horizontally (results-fixtures responsive)
